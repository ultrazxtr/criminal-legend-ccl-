           <p4><b>Common Types of Online Fraud</b>
           Before diving into the dangers of online fraud, you first need to know the common types of Online Fraud:
           </p4>
            <p5><b>phishing scams</b>target people all over the world, including Nepalese who work abroad. Fraudsters in these schemes pretend to be banks, government agencies, or other reputable organisations to trick people into giving them private information like passwords, financial details, or personal information. Most phishing attacks happen through emails.<br>The person receiving the email is tricked into clicking on malicious links or opening files that lead to fake websites that look like real ones. The goal is to get valuable information that can be used to steal people's identities or do illegal financial deals. To avoid phishing scams, it's important to stay alert, make sure emails and websites are real, and never send personal or financial information through channels that aren't safe

              <b>fake job offers</b>
              
              Fake job offers are a big problem for Nepalese people who work abroad because scammers take advantage of people's hopes of finding work abroad. Most of the time, these fake job offers claim high salaries, great benefits, and the chance to live a better life. But their real goal is to trick and scam job seekers who don't know what's happening. These scams can take many forms, like asking for money upfront to process a visa, asking for personal information to steal someone's identity, or even involving illegal activities like selling people.
               <br>
              To avoid getting scammed by fake job offers, you need to be careful and do a lot of studies. Check the company's legitimacy through official means, such as the website of an embassy or a reputable job site. Only send private information or money after ensuring the job offer is genuine. Remember that real employers will never ask for money upfront or private information before starting the official hiring process.
